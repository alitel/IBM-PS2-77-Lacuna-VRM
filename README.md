# IBM-PS2-77-Lacuna-VRM
This is an SMD implementation of a DIY VRM module for the IBM PS/2 Model 77 Lacuna Planar, allowing 100MHz CPU use

This was constructed using the information found here: https://www.ardent-tool.com/76_77/Lacuna_VRM.html

PLEASE NOTE: This is a work in progress and has not been tested yet. I will update this once testing is successful. Use in all cases is at your own risk.
